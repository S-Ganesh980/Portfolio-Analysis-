# Portfolio-Analysis-
Analyzing the portfolios Berkshire Hathaway, Tiger Global Management, Soros fund management and Paulson &amp; Co. compared to S&amp;P 500 index funds. 

 FinTech firms use algorithms to build client portfolios. The algorithms choose from different investment options. Here we determine the fund/portfolio with the most investment potential based on certain risk-management metrics. The outline of this project is as follows: 
 1. Analysis to determine if any of the aforementioned portfolios outperform the broader stock market that the S&P 500 index represents. 
 2. Analysis of the volatility of the portfolios.
 3. Evaluation of risk profile of each portfolio. 
 4. Analysis of Risk-return profile because the risk metrics do not describe the overall risk. We use Sharpe ratios for each portfolio to evaluate the risk-return profile. 
 5. Diversification of the portfolio based on how portfolios react relative to the broader market represented by S&P 500.
